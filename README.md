# Pybank-
I had some trouble managing the gitpush with this homework so I've uploaded my raw code both in the python script and in a notepad as a backup. 

The excel file just needs to be in a "Resources" folder for my code to run. 

I'll try to figure out the commit with git better for the next homework - thank you!
